# XOR Neural Network Simulation

## Introduction

XOR cauculation using neural network and dynamic memory allocation in C language.

## Description

This project shows that a XOR neural network simulation using the back-propagation learning algorithm by using dynamic memory allocation. In the input layer, there are two input layer neurons, which is 1 and 0. There are 4 ideal situations, which are 0^0=0, 0^1=1, 1^0=1, 1^1=0. There are three hidden layers, which has 3, 4, 3 hidden layer neurons. Lastly, there is one output layer neuron, which is the simulation result. At each epoch, I also add loss function related to the ideal case and the simulation result. At the final representation, you can see the ideal cases and the simulation results.

## Operation

./main
